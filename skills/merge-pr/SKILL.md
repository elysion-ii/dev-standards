# merge-pr

How to merge a GitHub pull request with the `gh` CLI.

## Strategy and message conventions

The merge strategy (squash by default), the squash-commit message composition rules, and
branch cleanup are defined in the `standards` skill's Git section, distributed in this
repository alongside this skill (`.claude/skills/standards/` / `.agents/skills/standards/`).
Read that section before composing the message. This skill holds only the `gh` operating
procedure.

## Procedure

1. Check the PR state with `gh pr view`: approvals, CI checks, merge conflicts. If checks
   are failing, report and stop — do not merge over a red CI without the user's explicit
   instruction.
2. Determine the strategy per the standards Git section (squash unless overridden).
3. Compose the subject and body from the PR's actual diff and commits, following the
   standards skill's Squash Commit Message Composition rules. Pass them explicitly with
   `--subject` and `--body` (or `--body-file`); use `--body ""` when nothing useful
   exists beyond the subject.
4. Merge: `gh pr merge <number> --squash --subject "..." --body "..."`.
5. Delete the source branch per the standards Branch Cleanup rules (prefer
   `--delete-branch` on the merge; under squash, local deletion needs `git branch -D`
   after confirming the PR is MERGED).
6. Verify the PR state is MERGED (`gh pr view`) and report the final commit message.
