# .NET Standards

Language rules file for .NET. Read together with `standard.md` (the language-agnostic
core) in the same directory. This file is token-free by design: concrete commands with
real project names (`dotnet format <App>.slnx`, ...) live in each repository's
`AGENTS.md`.

## Enforcement matrix

Rules marked **Enforced** are guaranteed mechanically by the project scaffold — a
violation fails the build — so AUDIT does not re-check them. Rules marked **AUDIT** have
no mechanical guard and must be checked during AUDIT. If the repository lacks the listed
mechanism (e.g., not yet retrofitted), treat that rule as an AUDIT item until the
mechanism is added.

| ID | Rule | Mechanism | Check |
|----|------|-----------|-------|
| FORMAT | Formatting follows `.editorconfig` | `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` gate in `Build.ps1` | Enforced — but run the formatter before completion (command in `AGENTS.md`) |
| ANALYZERS | Static analysis, warnings are errors | `Directory.Build.props`: `AnalysisLevel=latest-recommended`, `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors` | Enforced |
| NAMESPACE | File-scoped namespaces only | `.editorconfig` (`csharp_style_namespace_declarations=file_scoped:warning`) + warnings-as-errors | Enforced |
| ASYNC | No blocking on async code; no async without await | VSTHRD analyzers (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.Analyzers`); CS1998 as error | Enforced |
| VAR | Type inference usage | `.editorconfig` suggestions only | AUDIT |
| STRING | Explicit `StringComparison` | — | AUDIT |
| ERROR | Error handling | — | AUDIT |
| CANCEL | CancellationToken plumbing | — | AUDIT |
| FILEPATH | Paths relative to the executable | — | AUDIT |
| LOGGING | Log location, rotation, language | — | AUDIT |
| TEMPWORK | File operations via `%TEMP%` | — | AUDIT |
| CONSTANTS | No magic numbers/strings | — | AUDIT |
| COMMENTS | C# comment style | — | AUDIT |
| TESTNAME | xUnit test naming | — | AUDIT |
| VERSION | Single version definition + CHANGELOG release gate | Installer script `#ifndef MyAppVersion → #error` guard; the installer build injects the version and gates on a CHANGELOG heading | AUDIT — the gates cover only the installer path; "no `<Version>` in a csproj" has no guard |
| OUTPUT | No manual or committed build outputs | Output directories are gitignored by the scaffold | AUDIT — gitignore blocks commits, not manual additions |

---

## FORMAT: Code Formatting

- **Style definition:** `.editorconfig` at the repository root is the single source of formatting rules. To change a style, edit `.editorconfig` — never deviate per file
- **Always run the formatter before completing implementation**, and do not report completion unless its check mode (`--verify-no-changes`) passes — the exact command is in `AGENTS.md`
- `Build.ps1` runs the same verification and fails the build on unformatted code

## ANALYZERS: Static Analysis

- `Directory.Build.props` enables the built-in Roslyn analyzers (`AnalysisLevel = latest-recommended`, `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors`). **Warnings are build errors in every project**
- **Never disable or lower `TreatWarningsAsErrors` or `AnalysisLevel`.** To tolerate a specific warning, suppress it at the narrowest possible scope:

| Scope | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| A specific line | `#pragma warning disable <ID>` followed by `restore`. Reason comment required |
| A specific file/folder | `.editorconfig` section with `dotnet_diagnostic.<ID>.severity = none`. Reason comment required |
| A whole project | Add the ID to `<NoWarn>` in that csproj. Reason comment required |

- The reason comment states why this warning is acceptable here as a current constraint ("for now" or "fix later" is not a reason)

## ASYNC: Asynchronous Code

Refines the core's Synchronous vs Asynchronous section for .NET:

- **Never block on async code** (`.Result`, `.Wait()`, `GetAwaiter().GetResult()`) — enforced by the VSTHRD analyzers (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.Analyzers` in `Directory.Build.props`)
- **Do not mark a method async when nothing in it awaits** — CS1998 is an error under warnings-as-errors
- When a suppression is genuinely justified (e.g., a synchronous entry point mandated by a framework), follow the ANALYZERS suppression tiers with a reason comment

## NAMESPACE: Namespaces

- **File-scoped namespaces only** (`namespace X;`) — enforced via `.editorconfig` + warnings-as-errors

## VAR: Type Inference

- **Use `var`** for `new` expressions and other obvious types
- **Use explicit types** when the type is not clear from the right-hand side

## STRING: String Comparison

- **Always specify `StringComparison`** for string methods (`StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, `IndexOf`, `Contains`, `Equals`)
- **Use `StringComparison.Ordinal`** for technical comparisons (paths, identifiers)
- **Use `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`** when case-insensitivity is needed

## ERROR: Error Handling

- **No empty catch blocks:** Every `catch` must handle or log the exception
- **No raw exception messages in output:** Never display `ex.Message` directly to users
- **Don't log and rethrow:** The layer that handles an exception (catches without rethrowing) is responsible for logging it. A layer that rethrows must NOT log — each failure is logged exactly once

## CANCEL: Cancellation Token Propagation

- Every async method that performs potentially long I/O (DB, file, network, external process) MUST accept `CancellationToken ct = default` and pass it to every cancellable await — including static helpers and feature-internal classes, not only service entry points
- This applies even when no caller currently supplies a real token
- Do NOT pass `CancellationToken.None` where a `ct` variable is in scope
- Rationale: the project's `docs/adr/0001-cancellation-token-plumbing.md` (scaffolded into every project)

**Exempt — MUST NOT take a token (these operations must run to completion):**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Logging | logger implementations, exception-translation helpers |
| Transaction rollback | rollback helpers called from catch blocks |
| Best-effort cleanup | temp file deletion, post-failure cleanup |
| Post-commit finalization | file move/rename after a DB commit — aborting leaves files inconsistent with the committed data |

## FILEPATH: File Paths

- **Use `AppContext.BaseDirectory`** for paths relative to the application executable
- **Do NOT use `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()`** — it changes based on how the app is launched

## LOGGING: Log Output Location

- **Default:** `{AppContext.BaseDirectory}\Logs\` (relative to EXE location)
- **Fallback:** If write permission is unavailable, use `{Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)}\{AppName}\Logs\`
- **File name:** `{AppName}_yyyyMMdd.log` (daily rotation)
- **Log messages MUST be written in English**

## TEMPWORK: File Operations in %TEMP%

When I/O targets may be network paths, perform all file reads/writes in local `%TEMP%`.

- **Input**: Copy source files from network to `%TEMP%` before processing
- **Output**: Create artifacts in `%TEMP%`, then `File.Copy` / `File.Move` to the final destination
- **Naming**: Flat under `Path.GetTempPath()` as `{FeatureName}_{Guid.NewGuid():N}.{ext}`
- **Cleanup**: Always delete in `finally`. Deletion failure is best-effort (log and continue)
- **Recleanup of leftover files**: Don't rely on the `finally` deletion alone — a killed process or crash can skip it, so retry cleanup elsewhere too
  - **Desktop apps**: On next startup, retry deleting leftover temp files older than a threshold (tune to the app's run interval)
  - **Console/long-running apps**: On startup, or at a suitable point within the processing loop (start, end, etc. — whatever fits the app's structure), retry deleting leftover temp files the same way

## CONSTANTS: Constants

- **No magic numbers/strings:** Extract hardcoded values to named constants
- **Application constants** as `const` in the owning class

## COMMENTS: Code Comments (C# specifics)

The comment philosophy (when to write, what never to write) is in `standard.md`.
C# specifics:

- **Language:** English
- **Style:** Simple inline comments (`//`). No XML documentation

## TESTNAME: xUnit Test Naming

- Test method names use `Method_Scenario_ExpectedResult` (e.g. `Merge_EmptyInput_ReturnsEmpty`)
- Underscore separation is the official convention; for this reason CA1707 is suppressed via `<NoWarn>` in the test project's csproj
- Test row ordering and the other testing principles are in the `standard.md` Testing section

## VERSION: Version Management

- **The version is defined ONLY in the `<Version>` tag of `Directory.Build.props`.** Never add `<Version>` to a csproj or `#define MyAppVersion` to the installer script — duplicate definitions are how versions drift out of sync. The EXE inherits it via MSBuild; the installer build injects it (the `.iss` fails with `#error` when it is not injected)
- **Version bump**: update `<Version>`, add a `## [x.y.z]` heading and entry to `CHANGELOG.md` if it exists, and include both in the **same commit**. Building the installer without the changelog heading fails at the gate
- Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH); during development `0.x.x` (release as `1.0.0`); MINOR: new features, PATCH: bug fixes and small changes

## OUTPUT: Build Outputs

- **Never manually add files to build output directories, and never commit them** — outputs are produced only by the build scripts (the scaffold gitignores the output directories; `AGENTS.md` names them)
